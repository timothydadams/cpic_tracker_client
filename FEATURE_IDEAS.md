# Feature Ideas

Brainstormed feature list for CPIC Tracker, organized by category. Driven by the committee's bylaws and operational needs.

## Reporting & Town Council Communication

### Annual Report Generator

The bylaws require an annual report of activities for the fiscal year. A report builder that pulls from existing metrics (completion rates, on-time rates, overdue counts, scorecard grades) and lets the board add narrative context, then exports to PDF.

- **Bylaw driver:** Section V — required deliverable

### Town Council Recommendations

Section V requires all recommendations be "in writing to include a statement of findings and conclusions, and the reasons or basis therefore." A structured recommendation workflow — draft, attach supporting strategies/metrics, record the vote, and export as a formal document.

- **Bylaw driver:** Section V — required format

### Exportable Progress Reports

Beyond the annual report, the board likely needs to present progress snapshots at council meetings. Export-to-PDF for individual focus areas, implementer scorecards, or filtered strategy lists for meeting packets.

## Meeting & Governance Management

### Meeting Minutes & Agenda Builder

The secretary must maintain written records of all votes. A meeting module with agenda creation, minute-taking (linked to specific strategies being discussed), and vote recording to centralize governance records alongside the plan data.

- **Bylaw driver:** Section II (secretary duties), Section IV (vote recording)

### Attendance Tracking

The bylaws specify that missing 4 consecutive meetings without reasonable excuse creates a vacancy. Track attendance per member with automatic flagging at 3+ consecutive absences.

- **Bylaw driver:** Section II — vacancy rules

### Vote Tracking

Every committee action requires a majority vote of membership. Record votes on recommendations, plan amendments, and other actions — with the result and individual positions — to create the required public record.

- **Bylaw driver:** Section IV

## Committee Membership Management

### Member Term Tracker

Seven members with staggered 3-year terms expiring Dec 31. A dashboard showing current members, term start/end dates, officer roles (chair/vice-chair/secretary), and upcoming expirations to help the board and council plan for reappointments.

- **Bylaw driver:** Section II — staggered terms

## Plan Amendment Workflow

### Comprehensive Plan Amendment Proposals

The bylaws empower the committee to "prepare amendments to the Comprehensive Plan for the Town Council's consideration." A workflow for proposing amendments — with rationale, affected strategies, and council submission tracking.

- **Bylaw driver:** Section I — amendment authority

## Enhanced Oversight & Accountability

### Implementer Check-in Requests

The board oversees implementation but can't compel action — they're advisory. A structured check-in request system (request update -> implementer responds -> board reviews) to create a paper trail and make the liaison relationship more systematic.

### Strategy Risk / Early Warning Flags

Beyond overdue metrics, proactive flags like "no activity in 90 days," "deadline approaching with low progress," or "implementer hasn't responded to check-in" to help the board prioritize which strategies need attention at the next meeting.

### Trend Analysis / Historical Comparisons

With a 10+ year plan, showing year-over-year progress (completion rates trending up or down, focus areas accelerating or stalling) to strengthen annual reports and council presentations.

### Focus Area Priority Ranking

Let the board formally prioritize which focus areas or strategies need the most attention in a given period, creating a documented record of the committee's strategic emphasis.

## Communication & Notifications

### Implementer Digest / Newsletter

Periodic automated summaries sent to implementers showing their assigned strategies, upcoming deadlines, and recent board comments — keeping them engaged without requiring them to log in regularly.

### Public Meeting Notice System

The bylaws require public notice for all meetings (24 hours for special meetings). Integration with a notification system or simple posting mechanism.

- **Bylaw driver:** Section III — notice requirements

## Strategy Progress Tracking

### Milestones / Sub-tasks

The biggest gap in progress measurement. Currently a strategy goes from "Not Started" to "Complete" with no structured granularity in between. Breaking a strategy into milestones (e.g., "RFP issued" → "contractor selected" → "study completed" → "council adopted") gives measurable intermediate progress without relying on people remembering to leave comments. Could be templated per strategy type or fully custom.

### Budget / Funding Linkage

For a town, money is the most concrete progress signal. If a strategy got funded in the annual budget, that's real progress. If it's been proposed three years running and never funded, that tells you something too. Even a simple field tracking "funded / unfunded / partially funded" with dollar amounts adds a dimension that comments can't capture.

### Document / Deliverable Attachments

Many strategies produce artifacts — studies, ordinance drafts, RFPs, completed plans. Letting implementers attach deliverables as evidence of progress is more tangible than a status change. "Here's the completed traffic study" is harder to argue with than "status: in progress."

### Town Council Action Linking

If a strategy requires a council vote or ordinance change, linking to that action (date, result) is a concrete progress marker from an external, verifiable source. Also connects the oversight work back to the council relationship.
